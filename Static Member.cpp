/*
Example of Static variable in Class
-	Each object contains its own DM and shared FM. Static allows to shared DM among objects i.e counter or s/w license management
-	Mostly we declare static as private. Ctor and Dtor we declare in public section
-	An instance/normal MF can access instance as well as static DM
-	Static MF can only access static DM
-	This pointer never exist for static function. Hence we donâ€™t access it using object, we access using class
-	A static DM has nothing to do with static storage class
-	Static DM definition is require outside of class, Forgetting this could lead to error by linker not by compiler
